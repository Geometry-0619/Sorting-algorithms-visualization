# Sorting-algorithms-visualization
This project provides algorithm visualizations for classical sorting algorithms using Manim

Currently implemented:

- Bubble sort

- Selection sort

- Insertion sort

- Merge Sort

- Quick Sort

The animations help illustrate how sorting algorithms work step by step by moving colored boxes representing numbers.

Make sure you have [Manim Community Edition](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/uv.html) installed.
